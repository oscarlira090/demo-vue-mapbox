# NATIVESCRIPT VUE MAPBOX

This app shows a small example using MapBox in vue

The project has the next features:

- Search by address or place
- Add a marker
- Get Location
- Get directions (walking,drving,cycling) between current location and a marker

unfortunately could not make addLayer function work, so used addPolyline function (deprecated)
